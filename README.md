# Programming in Python
This repository contains the Python part of the course "Programming in Mathematica and Python"

### Goal of the course
This course is very short with only 1.5EC for the Python part of the course. The overall goal of the course is to get you sufficiently familiar with python, as well as, basic programming concepts in computational physics and data analysis, for you to become independent self-trained learners in python for computational physics.

### Exam
“Pass or Fail” based on submitted and reviewed assignments, and on the final project. 

### Plan of the course – Python part:
  - Py 1: Getting familiar with Python
  - Py 2: Bases of programming in Python
  - Py 3: NumPy arrays for efficient computing in Python
  - Py 4: Numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations (ODE) 
  - Py 5: Introduction to stochastic simulation
  - Week 6-8: Small computational project in Python and Mathematica

Additional material will be provided for these topics (will be useful for some of the exercises):
  - Py+: Data visualization with MatplotLib
  - Py+: Handling data with Panda

### Books
The course is based on the following books: 
  - Py1 and Py2: [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/index.html), by Jake VanderPlas, freely available in its online version.
  - Py3 and Py4: [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/), by Jake VanderPlas, freely available in its online version.
  - Py5: [Statistical Mechanics: Algorithms and Computations](https://books.google.nl/books/about/Statistical_Mechanics_Algorithms_and_Com.html?hl=fr&id=_9i8_hgi5CkC&redir_esc=y), by Werner Krauth.

Exercises are also inspired from the course (in French) [“Programming in C for physicists”](http://hebergement.u-psud.fr/mpo-informatique/) by Francois Naulin, and from the book [A student’s guide to python for physical modeling](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691219288/a-students-guide-to-python-for-physical-modeling) by Jesse M. Kinder and Philip Nelson.

### Tools.
We will work with **Python3** and assignments will be given in [**Jupyter notebooks**](https://jupyter.org/). If preferred, several options allow to use Jupyter notebook online, without having to install anything, such as [Google ColabLinks](https://colab.google/) or [JupyterLite](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/).
