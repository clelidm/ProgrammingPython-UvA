    "Lists are **ordered and mutable collection of objects**. They are defined using square brackets [] and the elements of the lists are separated by a comma. \n",

    "**Ordered elements:** The fact that elements are ordered allow to access any elements of the List via *indexing* or *slicing*.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Indexing:* You can access to any element of the List using its index. The index of the elements of the List starts from '0'. The last element of the list can also be access with the index '-1'; the previous to last with index '-2', etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Slicing:* You can access multiple values in sub-lists using the slicing syntax. For instance, <code>L[3:9]</code> returns a sub-list of <code>L</code>, starting from the element with index 3 (<code>L[3]</code>) and stopping with the element of index 8 (<code>L[8]</code>, i.e. element with index 9 excluded).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Accessing an element is O(1):* as a side note for those among you who are familiar with other languages, in python List are in fact implemented as arrays, which is why you can directly access any elements of the List with complexity O(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operation:** You can concatenate lists using the addition operator <code>+</code>. You can check the membership of an object within a list using the membership operators <code>in</code> or <code>not in</code>. \n",
